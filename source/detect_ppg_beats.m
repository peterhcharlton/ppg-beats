% DETECT_PPG_BEATS  detects beats in PPG.
%   DETECT_PPG_BEATS detects beats in a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal
%   using a specified beat detector
%   
%   # Inputs
%   
%   * s : a structure containing the following fields:
%    - v : a vector of PPG values
%    - fs : the sampling frequency of the PPG in Hz
%    
%   * beat_detector  - a string specifying the beat detector to be used
%   
%   # Outputs
%   * peaks : ...TBC...
%   * onsets : ...TBC...
