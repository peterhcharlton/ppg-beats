# `SWT_BEAT_DETECTOR` - SWT PPG beat detector.
SWT_BEAT_DETECTOR detects beats in a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal
using the 'Stationary Wavelet Transform' beat detector

##  Inputs
+   sig : a vector of PPG values
    
+   fs  : the sampling frequency of the PPG in Hz
    
##  Outputs
+   onsets : indices of detected pulse onets
    
+   peaks : indices of detected pulse peaks

##  Author
+   Dong Han - wrote the 'my_Vadrevu_2019_peakdet' function.
    
+   Peter H. Charlton - did very little, just wrote this wrapper and made a few changes to how the zero-padding of the signal is performed (as commented in the code).
