# PPG-beats documentation

**PPG-beats** is a Matlab library of algorithms to detect heartbeats in photoplethysmogram (*PPG*) signals.

PPG sensors are now used both in clinical devices (such as pulse oximeters) and consumer devices (such as smartwatches). A wealth of information can be obtained from PPG signals, including heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood oxygen saturation. A fundamental step in the calculation of such parameters is the detection of individual heartbeats. Indeed, several algorithms have been developed to detect heartbeats in PPG signals.

This library provides three key items:

1. **[Algorithms](./algorithms/ppg_beat_detection_algs)** to detect beats in PPG signals.
2. **[Datasets](./assessing_performance/datasets/)** and **[Code](./assessing_performance/code/)** with which to assess the performance of beat detection algorithms.
3. Tutorials on how to use the algorithms and code.
