## Importing the data into MATLAB

I took the following steps to import the WESAD dataset to MATLAB:

1. Download the data from [here](https://uni-siegen.sciebo.de/s/HGdUkoNlW1Ub0Gx) (as stated [here](https://ubicomp.eti.uni-siegen.de/home/datasets/icmi18/)).
2. Download the [`convert_subject_pickle_files_to_mat.py` python script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhcharlton/resources/master/collating_datasets/convert_subject_pickle_files_to_mat.py).
3. Copy the subject's _.pkl_ file to the same folder as this python script.
4. Run the python script to convert the _.pkl_ file into a MATLAB file. (I used Spyder - a Python program - through Anaconda-Navigator.)
5. Copy this MATLAB file back to the same folder as the _.pkl_ file was obtained from.
6. Download the [`collate_ppg_dalia_dataset.m` MATLAB script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhcharlton/resources/master/collating_datasets/collate_ppg_dalia_dataset.m).
7. Modify the MATLAB script by inserting the `up.paths.root_folder` and `up.paths.save_folder` into the `setup_up` function.
8. Run the MATLAB script to collate all the individual MATLAB files into a single MATLAB data file, ready for analysis.
